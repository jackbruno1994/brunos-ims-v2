# Bruno’s IMS — Architecture (M0 Snapshot)

This repo implements the M0 slice as per our previously defined architecture:
- Next.js app for POS/KDS/Inventory views.
- Node/Express + Prisma API aligned with OPENAPI.yaml.
- Postgres as DB.
- NGINX as reverse proxy.

Copilot should expand this towards the full architecture in the separate ARCHITECTURE pack when implementing later phases.
